# Final Report

## Summary

This repository implements a Codex-style coding runtime MCP server for workspace-confined coding primitives. It is not a Codex product wrapper.

Repository:

- https://github.com/ytagent/codex-tool-runtime-mcp

Current pushed evidence before this report:

- Latest verified CI commit: `7cada8b369eef55db6f8df2588d4d1943a62804e`
- CI run: https://github.com/ytagent/codex-tool-runtime-mcp/actions/runs/25957272106
- CI conclusion: `success`

## Implemented Tools

Default P0 tools:

- `read_file`
- `list_dir`
- `list_files`
- `search_text`
- `apply_patch`
- `exec_command`
- `write_stdin`
- `kill_session`
- `git_status`
- `git_diff`
- `request_permissions`

P1:

- `stdio` transport implemented.
- `view_image` implemented behind `--enable-view-image`.

Forbidden product-layer tools are not exposed.

## Subagents

Completed subagent reports:

- `codex-internals-researcher`: [reports/subagents/codex-internals-research.md](subagents/codex-internals-research.md)
- `competitor-researcher`: [reports/subagents/competitor-research.md](subagents/competitor-research.md)
- `mcp-contract-architect`: [reports/subagents/mcp-contract.md](subagents/mcp-contract.md)
- `security-sandbox-architect`: [reports/subagents/security-sandbox.md](subagents/security-sandbox.md)
- `test-harness-engineer`: [reports/subagents/test-harness.md](subagents/test-harness.md)
- `implementation-engineer`: [reports/subagents/implementation.md](subagents/implementation.md)
- `benchmark-engineer`: [reports/subagents/benchmark.md](subagents/benchmark.md)
- `release-docs-engineer`: [reports/subagents/release-docs.md](subagents/release-docs.md)
- CI verification: [reports/subagents/ci.md](subagents/ci.md)

Several later GPT-5.5 xhigh subagents requested by the user were attempted for CI, compliance verification, dogfood/benchmark verification, release docs, and review. The platform returned usage-limit errors before they could produce artifacts; this is recorded in the relevant reports.

## Compliance

Command:

```bash
make compliance
```

Evidence:

- [reports/compliance/latest.json](compliance/latest.json)
- [reports/compliance/latest.md](compliance/latest.md)
- status: `passed=true`
- tests: 29 run, 29 passed, 2 P1 image skips
- required P0 tools: all passed
- security: passed
- e2e: passed
- Codex dogfood: passed

GitHub Actions:

- https://github.com/ytagent/codex-tool-runtime-mcp/actions/runs/25957272106
- conclusion: `success`

## Dogfood

Evidence:

- [reports/dogfood/codex-on-mcp.md](dogfood/codex-on-mcp.md)
- [reports/dogfood/codex-on-mcp.json](dogfood/codex-on-mcp.json)
- conclusion: `PASS`

The deterministic MCP-only runner used MCP calls for search/read, patch, command execution, stdin sessions, and diff inspection. It reports no direct filesystem or shell bypass during task execution.

## Benchmark

Evidence:

- [reports/benchmark/swebench-regression.md](benchmark/swebench-regression.md)
- [reports/benchmark/swebench-regression.json](benchmark/swebench-regression.json)
- subset: [benchmarks/swebench/subsets/smoke-lite-10.json](../benchmarks/swebench/subsets/smoke-lite-10.json)
- predictions:
  - [benchmarks/swebench/predictions/baseline_native.jsonl](../benchmarks/swebench/predictions/baseline_native.jsonl)
  - [benchmarks/swebench/predictions/candidate_mcp.jsonl](../benchmarks/swebench/predictions/candidate_mcp.jsonl)

Conclusion:

```text
INCONCLUSIVE
```

The official SWE-bench harness was not run because Docker and the `swebench` Python package are unavailable in this environment, and the checked-in prediction files are placeholders. The project does not claim SWE-bench PASS.

## Security Limitations

- Command safety is policy-based, not a full OS/container sandbox.
- Network-looking commands and destructive command patterns are blocked or permission-required, but shell string policy is not a complete isolation boundary.
- `request_permissions` returns `ELICITATION_UNSUPPORTED` unless future client approval integration is added.
- Workspace escape is not grantable.
- `view_image` is P1 and disabled by default.

## Follow-Up Roadmap

1. Add an OS/container sandbox backend for `exec_command`.
2. Integrate MCP elicitation for permission grants.
3. Replace SWE-bench placeholder predictions with real native and MCP candidate runs.
4. Run official SWE-bench Lite smoke with Docker and `swebench`.
5. Expand Codex `apply_patch` compatibility vectors.
