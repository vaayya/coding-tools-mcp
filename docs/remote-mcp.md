# Remote MCP

This guide exposes `coding-tools-mcp` to remote MCP clients through an HTTPS tunnel.

The server implements Streamable HTTP at `/mcp`, publishes remote discovery metadata at `/.well-known/mcp.json` and `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`, and supports either no auth or static bearer-token auth on `/mcp`. OAuth-style authorization flows are intentionally out of scope for this server today, so clients that cannot send custom bearer headers should use anonymous `read-only` mode only for local/testing tunnels, or rely on an external auth proxy for production deployments.

## Profile Choice

Use `--tool-profile read-only` first. It exposes inspection and git read tools plus `set_default_cwd` for navigation, and omits workspace mutation tools such as `apply_patch`, `exec_command`, `write_stdin`, and `kill_session`.

Use `--tool-profile full` only for trusted MCP clients that support write tools and truthful annotations. Avoid `full` and `compat-readonly-all` for anonymous tunnel testing.

## One-Command Tunnel

Install the published package from PyPI, start the local server, and expose a read-only bearer-token tunnel:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xyTom/coding-tools-mcp/main/scripts/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- --tunnel cloudflared --auto-install-tunnel --workspace /path/to/repo
```

The script prints the local MCP URL, the tunnel provider's HTTPS URL, and the bearer header to configure in clients that support custom headers.

## Anonymous Read-Only Tunnel

```bash
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_AUTH_MODE=noauth \
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_TOOL_PROFILE=read-only \
scripts/tunnel.sh cloudflared /path/to/repo
```

Configure the remote MCP client with the HTTPS tunnel URL:

```text
https://<tunnel-host>/mcp
```

The discovery metadata reports auth type `none` in this mode. Anyone who can reach the tunnel URL can use the exposed read-only tools, so avoid sensitive workspaces and stop the tunnel when testing is done.

## MCP Clients With Bearer Auth

For clients that can send custom headers:

```bash
export CODING_TOOLS_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN="$(python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')"

CODING_TOOLS_MCP_AUTH_MODE=bearer \
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_TOOL_PROFILE=read-only \
scripts/tunnel.sh cloudflared /path/to/repo
```

Use:

```text
URL: https://<tunnel-host>/mcp
Header: Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Tunnel Scripts

Each script starts `coding-tools-mcp` on `127.0.0.1` and then starts the selected tunnel provider. If the provider CLI is missing, the script asks before installing it.

```bash
scripts/tunnel.sh cloudflared /path/to/repo
scripts/tunnel.sh ngrok /path/to/repo
scripts/tunnel.sh devtunnel /path/to/repo
```

Optional environment variables:

```bash
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_AUTO_INSTALL_TUNNEL=1
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_AUTH_MODE=bearer
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_PORT=8765
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_TOOL_PROFILE=read-only
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=<existing-token>
CODING_TOOLS_MCP_SERVER_BIN=coding-tools-mcp
```

If the selected tunnel CLI is missing, the scripts prompt before installing it. `cloudflared` installs into `~/.local/bin` when Homebrew is unavailable; `ngrok` uses Homebrew or npm; `devtunnel` uses the Microsoft installer script.

## Local Checks

Replace `BASE_URL` with the tunnel origin, without `/mcp`.

```bash
curl "$BASE_URL/.well-known/mcp.json"
```

For bearer mode only:

```bash
curl "$BASE_URL/mcp" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CODING_TOOLS_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN"

curl "$BASE_URL/mcp" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CODING_TOOLS_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"ping","params":{}}'
```

Missing or wrong bearer tokens on `/mcp` should return HTTP `401`.

## Security Notes

Keep the server bound to `127.0.0.1` and expose only the tunnel URL. Non-loopback binding without a bearer token is rejected. Use HTTPS tunnel URLs, rotate tokens if they are shared, and do not use `full` or `compat-readonly-all` with untrusted clients.

Anonymous remote MCP tunnel testing exposes whatever the selected profile permits to anyone who can reach the tunnel URL. Use `read-only`, avoid sensitive workspaces, and stop the tunnel when testing is done.
